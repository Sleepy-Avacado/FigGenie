# The drawing plan — say what the picture looks like before writing coordinates

The brief says what the figure *means*; the drawing plan says what it *looks like*. Write it after the spec
validates and before the first `<rect>`: a page of plain language that fixes the composition, so the SVG is
transcription rather than improvisation, and so the rendered PNG can be checked against a stated intent.
It lives next to the SVG as `plan.md`, goes to the user with v1 ("this is how I laid it out"), and is updated
whenever the layout changes. 120–300 words for a typical figure; longer only for two-panel or matrix figures.

## Sections

1. **Canvas** — column and size in pt (single 240 × 130–170; double 504 × 140–180), margins (≥ 4 pt),
   the grid you will snap to (e.g. 4 pt), the font key and base size (7 pt labels, 7.5–8 pt group titles,
   6 pt small print).
2. **Regions** — divide the canvas into named regions with approximate extents ("left 55 %: Host container;
   right 40 %: Backend; bottom strip 12 pt: legend"). One sentence per container / lane: stroke style, fill,
   where its title sits (top-left inside is the default), padding (≥ 6 pt around children).
3. **Placement** — for every node: region, row/column position, size (from `measure_text.py`: label width +
   8 pt, 1.4 × font size per line + 6 pt), shape idiom if not a rectangle (cylinder, stacked ×N, icon +
   label, picture + caption). State the alignment groups explicitly ("Client, Parser, Store share a baseline at
   y = 44; equal gaps of 10 pt"). For a bitmap, its box in pt at the picture's aspect ratio (or the crop), the
   pixel size that gives (≥ 150 ppi, 300 for photos), the frame, and where the caption sits.
4. **Routes** — the main path first: which sides it leaves and enters, orthogonal or straight, where the
   circled step numbers sit (upper-left of the arrow's midpoint, never on the line). Then secondary edges:
   dashed / dotted, colour role, how they avoid crossing boxes and text. Say which crossings, if any, are
   unavoidable and how they are disambiguated (a small gap or a hop).
5. **Emphasis** — exactly which element carries the accent (fill, border or thicker path) and what
   everything else does to stay quiet (grey / pastel fills, thin strokes). The figure's one point from the
   brief should be visible in this sentence.
6. **Legend, labels, annotations** — legend position and items, sublabels (§ references, "×N"), free
   annotations and their leaders.
7. **Check list for the PNG** — 4–6 concrete things to verify after rendering, derived from the above
   ("the accent box is the darkest thing on the page", "no arrow passes behind a label", "the three tier
   bands are equal height", "every label ≥ 6 pt when the page is at 100 %").

## Rules of thumb (corpus numbers)

- Boxes: 0.5–0.75 pt strokes, 1–2 pt corner radius, label padding ≥ 4 pt horizontal / 3 pt vertical.
- Gaps: equal gaps within a row (8–12 pt); containers pad their children by 6–10 pt; title band ≈ 1.6 × title size.
- Arrows: 0.7 pt lines, head length ≈ 4–5 × line width, main path 1.2–1.5 pt; leave 0.5 pt between a head and the box it enters.
- Steps: circled numbers ⌀ 8–12 pt at the arrow midpoints, in reading order, matching the caption.
- Text: one sans family, three sizes at most; nothing below 6 pt except badge digits.
- Bitmaps (print practice, not a corpus number): a local PNG / JPEG, box at its aspect ratio, ≥ 150 ppi at print
  size; a photo or screenshot gets a thin frame in the box stroke weight and its label as a caption clear of it.
- Whatever the plan cannot make fit at these numbers is a content problem — go back to the brief and merge or split, do not shrink type.

## Example (minimal figure)

> **Canvas.** Single column, 240 × 100 pt, 4 pt grid, Arimo 7 pt labels / 7.5 pt bold group title / 6 pt note.
> **Regions.** Host container x 8–168, y 14–74 (solid grey 0.8 pt, title top-left); Backend stands alone at x 186–226.
> **Placement.** One row at y 34–54: Client (40 wide), Span Parser (46, accent), Pattern Library (40, two-line label); Backend (40) outside. Gaps 10 pt inside the host; 24 pt to Backend marks the boundary.
> **Routes.** Straight left→right arrows at y 44 with filled heads; ① on e:1 at (61,37). Store→Backend dashed red with red head, label "sync" 6 pt above the line.
> **Emphasis.** Only Span Parser is orange with white bold text; everything else pastel/grey.
> **Legend.** None; a 6 pt note at the bottom explains grey/orange/dashed.
> **Check.** Orange box is the darkest fill; no text touches a line; four boxes share top and bottom edges; note stays ≥ 4 pt from the bottom.

## Mechanism figures — three more paragraphs

The seven sections above still apply (canvas, regions, placement, routes, emphasis, legend, check list). A
mechanism figure adds three paragraphs between **Regions** and **Placement**, because its composition is
decided by what repeats, what differs and how the reader moves — not by containers and tiers. Corpus shares
are from the 152 mechanism records (`references/mechanism/layouts.md`); they say what is common, not what is
required.

- **Repetition** — what the template is (the structure drawn once and repeated), how many panels or frames
  (45 % of figures have one drawing; panels median 3, rarely more than 4), their arrangement (row 25 %,
  grid 9 %, column 9 %, frames 7 %, inset 6 %) and whether positions are identical across panels
  (`identical` 21 %, `aligned` 47 %, `free` 32 %). State the panel size and gap once and the panel labels
  ((a)/(b), a name, or a caption line under each) and where they sit.
- **Difference** — exactly what changes from panel to panel or frame to frame, and the one marking style the
  figure uses for it: colour on the changed element (53 %), a callout (11 %), a badge (7 %), a dashed ghost of
  the old state, a strike — or nothing, when the difference is a label or a count the reader can see (26 %).
  Everything unchanged stays quiet: same grey, same weight, same place. If states are coloured, list the
  states and their colours here (`references/palettes.md` "Mechanism figures") and whether a legend is
  needed (70 % of figures manage without one; more than two coloured states usually needs one).
- **Reading path** — where the eye starts and how it moves: step markers (circled numbers 20 %, plain digits
  7 %, letters 7 %; on the arrow's upper-left, never on the line), the arrows themselves, panel order, a
  timeline's axis; and how the caption walks it (each marker gets a clause). For a worked example, which
  cells hold the input, intermediate and result values and how a value that recurs is linked (one colour per
  value is the corpus default; position or leaders otherwise).

Then **Placement** and **Routes** as above, per panel when the layout repeats (write the template once and say
"same in every panel"); **Emphasis** names the *difference* as the loudest thing; the **check list** gets the
mechanism items: panels the same size with elements at the same positions, the changed element visibly
different at 100 %, every branch of a decision labelled, markers in reading order and matching the caption,
values readable and results distinguishable from inputs, nothing below 6 pt in a repeated frame.

**When the figure fits none of this** — no panels, no steps, an arrangement of your own — write the three
paragraphs anyway in your own words (what repeats: "nothing"; what differs: "the highlighted subset"; reading
path: "from the query box to the three highlighted rows"). The plan is the place where a deviation from the
common shapes is stated, so the reviewer reads it as a choice.

### Example (mechanism, from `asplos25-006_fig1`)

> **Canvas.** Single column, 240 × 118 pt, 4 pt grid, 7 pt labels / 6.5 pt bar labels.
> **Regions.** Two panels stacked, each 240 × 52 pt, 8 pt apart; panel tag (a)/(b) top-left inside, 7.5 pt bold.
> **Repetition.** Template = Device 0 / Device 1 dashed boxes with the chain fwd → bwd → update; drawn identically in both panels (same x for every stage, same y within its panel).
> **Difference.** Panel (b) adds an AllGather bar before fwd and before bwd and replaces the AllReduce label with ReduceScatter; the added bars are the only saturated fill (blue); collective names in red italic in both panels so the rename is comparable.
> **Reading path.** Left to right along the chain in (a), then the same in (b); no step numbers — the caption names the phases.
> **Placement / Routes.** … (as above, once, "same in (b)").
> **Emphasis.** The blue bars in (b) are the darkest thing; everything else pastel and grey.
> **Check.** Both panels the same height with stages at the same x; blue bars visibly distinct at 100 %; the two red labels differ in text only; no label below 6.5 pt; panel tags do not collide with the device boxes.

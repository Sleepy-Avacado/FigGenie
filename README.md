## Examples

The figures below are examples drawn by FigGenie Skill. It draws editable vector graphics, not bitmaps from an
image-generation model, so you can open them in **Illustrator**, **PowerPoint** and similar tools and keep editing.
Chinese text and formulas are supported too. The systems, components and numbers in the figures are invented.

## Why FigGenie

- **Learned from real figures, not from taste.** Its rules come with numbers, measured on 2,041 hand-rated figures
  from top systems venues.
- **Drawn at print size.** It works in points for a 240 pt column, so the labels stay readable in the paper and not
  only on screen.
- **Every figure is checked.** A linter measures every box in a headless browser, and the agent looks at the render
  before handing anything over.

### Learned from 12,577 top-venue figures

We collected the figures of every OSDI, NSDI, SOSP and ASPLOS paper from 2023 to 2026, rated 2,041 of them by hand,
and measured what separates the good ones from the rest.

| Corpus          | Size                                                                                                     |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Papers          | 1,113 from OSDI, NSDI, SOSP and ASPLOS, 2023 to 2026                                                     |
| Figures indexed | 12,577                                                                                                   |
| Rated by hand   | 2,041                                                                                                    |
| Distilled into  | 20 layout templates, 5 mechanism families, 21 palettes, 485 annotated exemplars and 2,853 reusable parts |

## Quick start

Simply drop the URL of this repo into your AI agent and ask it to install the skill:

```text
Install this skill and set up its dependencies: https://github.com/Sleepy-Avacado/FigGenie
```

Or install it manually:

**Claude Code**: install the plugin.

```text
/plugin marketplace add Sleepy-Avacado/FigGenie
/plugin install figgenie@figgenie
```

**Codex and other agents**: FigGenie is a plain Agent Skill, a folder with a `SKILL.md`, scripts and references. Any
agent that loads skills, runs shell commands and can look at a PNG can use it.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sleepy-Avacado/FigGenie.git
mkdir -p ~/.agents/skills
ln -s "$PWD/FigGenie/skills/figgenie-paper-diagram" ~/.agents/skills/figgenie-paper-diagram
```

Older Codex releases read skills from `~/.codex/skills` instead.

**Requirements**: Python 3 and a headless Chromium for rendering and linting.

```bash
pip install lxml pillow playwright fonttools
playwright install chromium
```

Optional: Node.js 18+ for TeX formulas (MathJax installs itself on first use), and `pip install python-pptx` for the
PowerPoint export (native equations there also need Office's `mathml2omml.xsl`).

## Features

| Feature          | What you get                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Figure kinds** | Architecture figures in 20 layout templates. Mechanism figures in five families: comparison, evolution, logic, walkthrough and anatomy, with worked examples in real values. |
| **Outputs**      | An SVG with fonts embedded and every element named, a PDF cut to the figure's size for LaTeX, a PNG preview and a caption draft. An editable PowerPoint deck on request.     |
| **Content**      | Vector TeX formulas, Chinese and other CJK labels, icons from a 2,853-part library, and bitmaps such as screenshots or photos.                                               |
| **Workflow**     | A brief before drawing, a lint and visual self-check after every edit, changes in plain words, and critiques or redraws of existing figures.                                 |

**Editable in PowerPoint.** On request, the finished figure becomes a deck with one native shape per primitive, at the
same coordinates as the SVG.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Figures in the style of top AI venues (NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, CVPR, ACL)
- [ ] An interactive editor
- [ ] Support for more editors (draw.io, OmniGraffle and others)
